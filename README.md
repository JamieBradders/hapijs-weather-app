# My Demo Weather App
This app was built with hapi.js. More info to follow as I work through it, simply run `npm install` then `node server.js` to run the server. Refer to the code for the routes etc.

## Note!
If you stumble across this repository then just disregard for now, it's a development in progress and a way for me to practice using the hapi.js framework. Feel free to clone it's current version as a baseline and refactor to your heart's content but please don't judge ðŸ˜‰
